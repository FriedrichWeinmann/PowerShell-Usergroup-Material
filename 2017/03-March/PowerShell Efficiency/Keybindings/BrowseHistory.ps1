<#
This command searches the current history and provides you with a list of available options, to directly insert into your console.
Selecting multiple lines is possible, but the order is fairly arbitrary, due to Out-Gridview.

Note:
There are other sources of history. My code uses Get-History, however, if you like using the PSReadline feature of a command logfile,
you may find it useful to parse that instead. Incidentally, that's exactly what the original PSReadline example from which this snippet
has been inspired was doing, so if that's your preference, feel free to check it out and 'pilfer' the original ;)
